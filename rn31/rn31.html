<i>www.roxsoftware.com</i></a> will be even
more up to date.</p><p>Uninstall any previous version of MC-3020 before beginning
the installation process.</p><p>Note MC-3020 will need to be unintalled and reinstalled
after upgrading BridgePoint.  MC-3020 relies on components within
BridgePoint.  This uninstall/reinstall must occur any time that BridgePoint
is altered substantially (e.g upgrade, change in location of
model repository).  ROX_* environment
variables need to be set to point to the
correct (new) locations.  Specifically, the variables
ROX_PT_HOME and ROX_PT_REPOSITORY_HOME need to 
link to the correct directories.  These variables use the
old 8.3 format names.  <b>DIR /X</b> is the
DOS command to see the underlying file and path names.</p><p>Note that MC-3020 may not install onto a system that does not

    <i>Cygwin</i></a>.  MC-3020 3.1 has
    Cygwin (and ksh) support right on the CD.  Installation
    is automatic.</p><p>If you already have Cygwin installed, the MC-3020 installation
    CD will detect it and not install Cygwin.  However, you may
    need to upgrade your Cygwin installation to include packages
    such as make, perl and xsltproc if you do not have them.</p><p>Permissions issues with Cygwin can pose an issue.  Once
    Cygwin is installed executables may be configured to allow
    only the owner of the file to read them and execute them.
    By default, BridgePoint is set such that only an adminstrator can
    run the <tt>repository_bin</tt> executables.
    Keep this in mind if you seem to be having difficulty getting
    some build steps to execute correctly.  Access can be
    granted to the executables using the <b>chmod</b>
    command (in the bin directory in question type <b>chmod
    ugo+rx *.exe</b>).</p><p>The 3.1 release CD of MC-3020 has automatic installation
    of Cygwin and ksh.  These instructions will serve to document
    where these files are expected to be.</p><p>If you run MC-3020 on Windows, uninstall MKS.</p><p>MC-3020 uses the Korn shell in the build environment.
    Korn shell does not (as of this writing) come standard with Cygwin.
    A distribution of the public domain Korn
    shell (<b>ksh</b>) is provided with MC-3020.  Find it
    in <tt>mech/windows/pdksh-5.2.14-1.tar.gz</tt> (or
    similar) in the mc3020 installation directory.  Untar the
    the archive and place the executable in the /bin of your
    Cygwin installation.

  and support for preexisting instances (PEIs) defined in data.
  In concert with these two major enhancements, support for initialization
  functions is supplied.  Some additional coloring options are
  added and a few performance enhancements.  The installation package
  has been enhanced to automatically install Cygwin and ksh.  And
  a few bugs have been fixed.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2756688"></a>Upgrade Notes</h3></div></div><p>There are some changes to the build environment in 3.0

      superior technology exists in the freely available Cygwin
      (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">
      <i>Cygwin</i></a>).  MKS is no longer
      supported.</p><p>Cygwin provides most of what MKS supplies and more.
      The utilities needed for the build environment are part of
      Cygwin with the exception of <b>ksh</b> which
      is supplied in the MC-3020 distribution (in
      <tt>mech/windows/pdksh*</tt>.</p><p>The installation CD configures Cygwin and ksh

      <tt>TagTransformerGeneration</tt> is no longer
      supported.  <tt>TagTransformerGeneration</tt> was
      originally supplied as a testing and debug color to provide
      scaffolding for normally unmodeled function.  Now that BridgePoint Model Builder
      supports class operations standard, it does not make sense to
      translate only those operations colored with
      <tt>TagTransformerGeneration</tt>.  This coloring
      function will now do nothing.</p><p>As of version 3.1, all class (and instance) operations
      will be translated by default.
      <tt>TagClassOperationTranslationOff</tt> is
      supplied to disable transformer/operation translation.  This
      allows integration of hand-coded operations
      (transformers).</p><p>This change may you require to edit the coloring files
      of existing models in order for translation to occur
      correctly.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2756820"></a>System File Name Changes</h4></div></div><p>Internal issue 91 documented a problem with the naming
      of some system include files.  (See below.)  The names of
      generated include files are now different.  This change will
      require <b>make clean_all_src</b>,
      <b>make clean_sys_src</b> and
      <b>make all</b> to retranslate existing system
      nodes.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2755425"></a>Enhancements</h3></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2755433"></a>Preexisting Instances Defined in Data</h4></div></div><p>Support for preexisting instances defined in data is in
      MC-3020 3.1.</p><p>The new make target <b>make dom_xml</b> will
      perform an XML extraction from the generation database.  This
      extracted XML fully describes/defines the user application
      system.  The format of the XML is suitable for delivery to
      the BridgePoint Model Debugger.</p><p>In 3.0, the Instance subsystem was added to the MC-3020
      meta-model.  This subsystem schema has tables for instances,
      links, attribute values, etc.</p><p>Following is an example of the gain (reduced code size)
      achieved by defining preexisting instances in data.  Below are size
      measurements of a test case.  The first case shows the output of
      the <b>size</b> command for a normal init-object-style
      generation (gcc/Cygwin).  The second shows using
      <tt>PEIsDefinedInData</tt>.</p><p>To interpret the table:

      </p><p>This is a conservative test case.  There are no state machines
      in the model.  However there is procedural action language to
      access all of the instances either created or defined in data.
      The test case creates a total of 84 instances of 23 different
      objects with 39 links.</p><p>This simple test demonstrates a 15% reduction in code
      space and a significant speed-up in terms of initialization.
      Models with many preexisting instances will see very large
      reductions in code size.</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id2755739"></a>Constructs Supported</h5></div></div><p>In MC-3020 3.1, preexisting instances can be defined in data

      BridgePoint Model Debugger.  Use the coloring function
      <tt>TagModelDebuggingOn</tt> to enable the
      generation of this tooling code.
      Real-time debugging of translated models is now possible.
      See the appropriate BridgePoint Model Debugger documentation from Project Technology, Inc.
      for details.</p><p>With the addition of debugging with BridgePoint Model Debugger another
      touch point between plain ASCII character sets and Unicode
      character sets is exposed.  During a debug-enabled translation,
      the model compiler access and embeds various constructs from
      within the BridgePoint UML model into the generated code.  The constructs
      include the names and values of UML modeling elements.  Many of
      these elements can be encoded in international character sets
      (for example Shift_JIS).</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2755867"></a>Domain Function Coloring</h4></div></div><p>Two new colors have been added to facilitate the 
      process of preparing the XML representation of preexising
      instances.  These colors are also useful in general.</p><p><tt>TagInitializationFunction</tt> marks
      function(s) to be executed during bring-up.  This effectively
      replaces initialization objects.  (Initialization objects are
      still supported, but discouraged.)  Functions tagged to run at
      initialization bring-up can also be called during run time
      processing.  Functions tagged for initialization are run in
      alphabetical order.</p><p><tt>TagFunctionTranslationOff</tt> disables
      the translation of functions.  This is convenient for
      enabling/disabling test cases.  It is especially nice for PEI
      support.  An init function can be tagged for running with model
      debugger.  It can then be tagged off for the production compile
      using preexisting instances (PEIs) defined in data.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2755914"></a>Create/Delete/Link/Unlink Optimization</h4></div></div><p>MC-3020 has extended its optimization capability
      with regard to code reduction.
      Create, delete and link accessors are not generated unless
      actually needed.  Previous versions of MC-3020 were able
      to optimize out some delete and link accessors.  Create
      accessors were generated unconditionally.</p><p>With the advent of preexisting instances defined in
      data it is possible for a system to have instances that were
      not created by action language in the system but were defined
      in data.  As such, some classes may not need create accessors.</p><p>During first pass translation, MC-3020 identifies
      all creates, deletes, links and unlinks that are needed.
      All accessors are assumed to be not needed until action
      language is identified that uses the accessor.  Only those
      accessors actually used in action language are generated.</p><p>With a static instance population composed totally
      of preexisting instances defined in data, it is possible to
      have a large number of instances that are rich with attributes
      and related with many other instances that have no create,
      delete, link or unlink accessors!</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2755983"></a>Empty Handle Checking</h4></div></div><p>Additional checks for empty handles have been eliminated.
      This will result in smaller code.  The relate/unrelate (link/unlink)
      code formerly tested the input parameters unconditionally.  These
      checks are now generated only when
      <tt>TagEmptyHandleDetectionOn()</tt> has been executed.
      All of the checks that had formerly been made are still available
      with this color.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2756009"></a>Tagging Operations and Transformers</h4></div></div><p>As of version 3.1, all class (and instance) operations
