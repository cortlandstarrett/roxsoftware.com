>Feature additions for this release focus on supporting the
    extensive new feature set of BridgePoint 5.0 including polymorphic
    events, domain functions (synchronous services), operations,
    mathematically dependent attributes and more.  Please see the latest
    version, 1.4, of the BridgePoint 5.0 Feature List for complete
    details on the enhancements put into this release.
    The feature list is available on the Project Technology, Inc. web site at

>Bridging into OOA domains can now occur without "Funky
    Bridge Objects" (although FBOs remain supported).
    Domain functions ("synchronous services") can
    serve as bridges into the domain.  Interface declarations are
    generated automatically and can be included by user code or code
    from other domains.  This results in a much cleaner bridge.</P

>The new user callout function
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UserEventNoInstanceCallout( current_state, next_state, event )</B
>
    has been added to provide a home for detection of events landing
    on instances that no longer exist.  This situation can indicate
    a modeling error.  The new callout enables attention to be drawn
    to this usually erroneous situation.
    <B

    and is designed to behave exactly the same as

>Field Issue 188:  String Arithmetic</DT
><DD
><P
>MC-3020 is targeted to the deeply embedded
      control marketplace.  Full support for all flavors of string
      arithmetic has the potential for drawing in additional string
      library code making the linked image larger.  Focus has been
      placed more on enumerated types, user-specified precision and
      bit fields over string manipulation.  However, incorrect string
      manipulation code needs to be corrected.</P
><P
>A fix has been supplied to the field and is part of the
      2.0 release.  Simply, binary string arithmetic
      should now be correctly supported.  result = s1 + s2 + s3 is
      not supported.  However, the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Escher_stradd</B

      change provides for commutativity of addition.</P

>Field Issue 252:  Prioritized Event in
Transformer</DT
><DD
><P
>Event priority uses Self to boost its way
      toward the front of the event queue.  Self was not accessible
      within a transformer.  MC-3020 already maintains counts of the
      various types of events being generated.  So a method was
      provided in system.arc (Escher_GetSelf) which accesses a static
      containing the target of the most recently dispatched event.
      This method is used in transformers to access Self when
      priority events are generated.</P

>Field Issue 258:  Container Deallocation</DT
><DD
><P
>This bug was introduced in the support for the
      break, continue and return action language statements.</P
><P
>The container deallocation problem is another name for
      the "break, continue, return" problem.  Break, continue and
      return action language statements result in generated code that
      under some circumstances involving SELECT MANY followed by a
      loop containing a break, continue or return can leak instance
      containers (a.k.a. containoids).  This leads to a
      failure when all containoids are exhausted.</P
><P
>A fix and patch was delivered for the field.  Version
      1.3.2 contains this fix.</P
><P
>The fix to the 1.x version is effective but somewhat
      inelegant and brute force in the archetypes.  It defines a
      macro at the beginning of an action using break/continue/return
      that knows how to clear the reference sets.  At the end of the
      action, the macro is invoked to clear these reference
      sets.</P

>Field Issue 261:  Compatibility between MC-3020 and MC-2010 SARD</DT
><DD
><P
>This was not a bug.  However, it is good for
      MC-3020 to behave the same way as MC-2010 in this case.</P
><P
>The value of a reference variable after a loop is not
      well defined.  Action language which assumes a value when there
      is no break is following a loose practice.  Note that after a
      break statement, the reference variable will contain the
      expected (current) instance.</P
><P
>The (simple) change to the archetype leaves the reference
      ("loop") variable untouched for an empty set.  The variable
      will contain the last instance in non-empty sets.</P

      modeling restriction.  This has been the behavior of MC-3020
      since its first release (1.0).</P
><P
>Further investigation/development is required.  Selecting
      the many associator from the associative object is much easier
      in a foreign key, database oriented design as in MC-2010.  The
      optimized pointer reference strategy in MC-3020 makes this a
      tough problem.  A design is currently being considered.
