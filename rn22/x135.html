>MC-3020 2.2 has refined its support for the features 
  of BridgePoint 5 and has fixed problems discovered in the 2.1 version of
  MC-3020.  However, MC-3020 2.2 is primarily a
  partner release to BridgePoint 5.1, required due to schema changes.</P

>A new callout function has been added to allow error
    handling when too many Interleaved Bridges have been invoked
    overflowing an architectural queue.</P
><P
>To support polymorphic events in MC-3020 2.2,
    a $T "nosplat" filter is required in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>[PT install dir]/BridgePoint/[client_type]/client/lib/[libtrans.lib]</TT
>.</P
><P
>If a customer has a custom libtrans.* (typically done for
    internationalization purposes), that library must be updated to
    provide "nosplat". The default libtrans.* supplied by PT has this
    filter in it.</P
><P
>An example of PT "nosplat" is provided in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>[PT install dir]/BridgePoint/samples/translate/pt_trans.c</TT
>.</P
><P
>The "nosplat" filter simply needs to remove the "*" character (as
    associated with polymorphic events in ModelBuilder) from the presented
    string.</P

><P
>The MC-3020 meta model has been changed per the release
      notes of BridgePoint 5.1.  MC-3020 2.2 translates only
      models generated from BridgePoint 5.1.</P

>Field Issue 447:  Synchronous Service
      Problem</DT
><DD
><P
>Corrected.</P
><P
>In this issue, the user tried to return data
      across an interleaved bridge.  This is not possible.
      Interleaved bridges use "disconnected invocation"; the first
      section of the bridge operation posts the second section to
      a queue to be invoked at a safe time.  Therefore interleaved
      bridges must return void.</P
><P
>Code was added to coloring to cause translation to fail
      with coloring errors when the user attempts to color a non-void
      bridge to be safe for interrupt
      invocation.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 454:  make bridge_skel</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>Makefile.domain had incorrect invocation of rox_get_dom_branch.
      Removed inconsistent config_version argument to rox_get_dom_branch.

>Field Issue 455:  Interleaved Bridge
      Callout</DT
><DD
><P
>Interleaved bridging (safe for interrupts) uses
      a queue to post the bridge operations for execution between
      state actions.  There was no explicit recovery code to handle
      the situation when this queue was overflowed.
      A new user callout function <PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UserInterleavedBridgeOverflowCallout()</PRE
> was added.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 458:  No states in State
      Chart</DT
><DD
><P
>Corrected.</P
><P
>Before polymorphic events, a state model with no states,
      transitions or events was harmless.  However, with polys,
      it is possible for an event to land on a state chart with
      no states.  This could be dangerous.  In this situation, there
      is no opportunity to distinguish between Ignore and
      Can't Happen.</P
><P
>A change has been made to generate code that will fail
      to compile in this situation.</P

>Field Issue 459:  max_select_extent
      not found</DT

      fixed.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 460:  Bridge not interrupt
      safe</DT
><DD
><P
>Corrected.</P
><P
>This was an attempt to use a feature that does not exist.
      Here, an old FBO type bridge action was trying to receive
      parameters from another context.  Parameter passing across
      interleaved bridges is supported only for synchronous
      services (domain functions).</P
><P
>Added a test to fail out attempts to use FBOs for this
      type of activity and added wording in the User Guide that
      makes this more clear.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 464:  Bool not defined</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>The boolean type was not defined in certain situations.
      The required include file was added in the erroneous situation.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 478:  Assignment to bridge param</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>Code was missing for bridge parameters (by reference).
      Added it to frag_bridge.arc and changed fragment to call new code.
      This is consistent with sync_services and transformers.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 227:  Bridge coloring error</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>Strings were not processed correctly in
      clr_bridge.arc.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field Issue 228:  Incorrect Makefile
      generated for transformers</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>When transformers were part of a bridge object,
      correct code was generated, but the makefile did not compile
      and link it.</P

><DT
>Field Issue 230:  Bad enumeration values
      in transformer code</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P

      the enumerator value names.</P
></DD
><DT
>Internal Issue 74:  bridge_skel fails on empty
      subsystem.</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>When a model domain (subsystem) does not have any classes,
      MC-3020 generates error messages when running "make bridge_skel".
      A test for empty subsystems has been added.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>Internal Issue 75:  Make targets unavailable.</DT
><DD
><P
>Fixed.</P
><P
>The make targets for the Single Directory Environment (SDE)
      were not operating properly.  Additionally, the clobber target
      was not deleting the html reports.  Note that the Single Directory
      Environment is developed for a few compilers that cannot deal with
      multiple directories of source and include files.
