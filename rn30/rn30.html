  which provides many new features and optimizations and provides
  the infrastructure for UML Debugger support and Static Instance
  Population (SIP) capability.  Both of these latter features will
  be fully supported in version 3.1 which will follow shortly after
  the 3.0 release.

ROX_PT_HOME and ROX_PT_REPOSITORY_HOME need to correctly
link to the correct directories.  These variables use the

      a doubly-linked list (dlist).  With the added flexibility of the
      dlist &quot;containoid&quot;, delete operations from instance collections
      greater than 100 are substantially faster.  The cost is an
      additional pointer size of storage for each container in the
      system.  This option is colorable.</p><p>The default singly-linked list (slist) collection 
      mechanism of MC-3020 is compact but suffers a linear search
      overhead to delete an object instance from the collection.
      For the price of a one pointer size of storage the new
      doubly-linked (dlist) mechanism provides a constant time
      instance deletion.  A chapter discussing this topic in some
      detail is published in the Users Guide.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761598"></a>Collection Mechanism Streamlining</h4></div></div><p>Trimmed some of the storage being used to manage
      collections.  One pointer per object of static storage is saved.
      One pointer of instance storage is saved for every instance
      having a many relationship with another instance.  Code was
      reduced slightly in the object factory routines.  The set
      mechanism has been streamlined.  This results in a little less
      data and a little less code being generated.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761620"></a>Smaller Factory Init Code</h4></div></div><p>Trimmed code out of the factory initialization and create
      accessors for each class.  More of the work is now performed by a
      called routine.  This results in a smaller generated code
      image.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761636"></a>Clear Instances Speedup</h4></div></div><p>Improved the speed of clearing instance reference sets
      (<pre class="programlisting">inst_ref_set</pre>s).  The clear set
      operation is most often used to deallocate transient set
      variables.  It now runs roughly twice as fast as before.
      This is accomplished by linking the list of instances into
      the free list as a chain rather than freeing them one at a
      time.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761663"></a>Discreet System User Callouts</h4></div></div><p>Changed the system user callout functions mechanism 
      <tt>sys_user_co.*</tt> to not generate
      callouts when not needed or to declare empty macros by
      default for the callout functions.  This will effectively
      eliminate them from functional compilation unless explicitly
      added by the user.  This enhancement reduces the size of the
      generated code image.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761690"></a>Improved ANSI C Purity and Simplicity</h4></div></div><p>MC-3020 is purely ANSI C and generates code that can be
      compiled by any compiler compliant with the ANSI standard.  The
      core model compiler now uses no libraries or system functions at
      all.  Generated code is pure native C.  All string manipulation
      library functions (memcpy, strcpy, strcat and related) used in
      previous version have been eliminated.  Native C functions have
      replaced these system calls.  This has been accomplished in such
      a way that a user can redefine the functions with a small
      archetype change or macro definition.</p><p>This change makes it simpler and easier to integrate with
      compilers of various makes and models and manufacturers.  In
      addition, some simpler compilers will link in an entire library
      of system functions when any single function is accessed from
      the library.  Only <tt>stdio.h</tt> remains as
      exposure on this front.</p><p><tt>stdio.h</tt> is included simply for convenience
      during debug (for <b>printf</b>, etc).  All generated
      code is simple, native C.  When integrating realized external
      entities and timer services (TIM), other system libraries will
      be necessary.  However, the core OOA generated code remains
      simple ANSI C.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761747"></a>Imminent Static Instance Population</h4></div></div><p>Support for Static Instance Population is coming shortly in
      MC-3020 3.1.</p><p>The new make target <b>make dom_xml</b> will
      perform an XML extraction from the generation database.  This
      extracted XML fully describes/defines the user application
      system.  The format of the XML is suitable for delivery to
      the BridgePoint Model Debugger.</p><p>The Instance subsystem has been added to the MC-3020
      meta-model.  This subsystem schema has tables for instances,
      links, attribute values, function invocations, etc.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2761776"></a>Infrastructure for BridgePoint Model Debugger</h4></div></div><p>Code generated with MC-3020 is tooled for use with
