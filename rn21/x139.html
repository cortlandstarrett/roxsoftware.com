>Bridge operations colored as safe for interrupts can now pass
    parameters into the domain.  These "Interleaved Bridges" allow
    control and data to be passed from one microprocessor context
    (interrupt service routine, process, task, etc.) into the
    modeled OOA domain.  These data are protected from cross context
    corruption while traversing from the interrupt context (or
    parallel/concurrent task) into the OOA context.  Interrupt Service
    Routines may now pass multiple data arguments into synchronous
    service bridge operations colored as safe for interrupts.</P
><P
>Polymorphic events can now be generated to leaf subtypes.  This
    will also allow for polymorphic event to self even when the
    instance referred to by self is a subtype below in hierarchy from
    the supertype for which the event is named.</P
><P
>Some minor enhancements in compatibility between the coloring
    of MC-3020 and MC-2020 have been applied to MC-3020.  Further
    consistency between these two model compilers is planned.</P
><P
>A mechanism has been added to allow the idle loop to be shut
    down cleanly and gracefully permitting main to exit.</P

>New archetype code was added to allow polymorphic
      events to be directed at instances below the top of the object
      hierarchy including the "leaf" instance.  This also allows a
      polymorphic event to be generated to self.

>The Users Guide has been updated to provide
      this documentation.  MC-3020 2.0 provided support the version
      5 enumeration support in BridgePoint Model Builder.  The older method of marking
      enumerations in attribute descriptions is supported but
      discouraged.</P

>This turned out to be a problem in support
      code and not in the model compiler itself.  The sample timer
      code (TIM_bridge.c) had a problem in the TIM_create_date
      routine.  This routine has been updated for use in samples
      and examples.</P
