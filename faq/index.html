Name spacing
  is absent.</p><p>Consider
  <pre class="programlisting">
  enum rock
  {
    red = 1
  };
  enum stone
  {
    red = 2
  };
  ...
  material_color = red;
  </pre>
  Since enum is not scoped by a C++(ish) class, and
  C has no namespacing, there is no way for a C compiler to
  distinguish which ``red'' to assign to material_color.
  Note that these declarations may live in separate include
  files.  Thus, MC-3020 uses ``long winded'' namespacing
  of <b>#define</b> to avoid the C language
  weakness.</p><p>Another weakness lies in the lack of control over
  the storage allocated to variables declared to be of
  enumerated type.  In resource constrained environments (say
  an 8-bit micro), we would like our enums to take up
  something less than an integer of storage.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2805242"></a>What are bridge and transformer skeletons?</h2></div></div><p>(From the MC-3020 UG:)  Based upon information modeled in
  BridgePoint Model Builder, MC-3020 automatically generates source
  code frameworks for bridge and transform implementation. These
  skeleton files will actually compile as generated. The user is
  saved from delving into generated code to divine interfaces
  required for these boundary functions.  Kind and helpful comments
  are provided to guide insertion of bridge and transform
  implementation code.</p><p>Generated xform and bridge header files are under
  the context and control of the translation engine.  Skeleton
  implementation files (<tt>skel/XXX_xform.c</tt>)
  are provided as a convenience for the user.  These provide
  correct method signatures, requisite include files, etc.
  The user ``inserts implementation code here''.</p><p>Note that BridgePoint Generator has some translation idiosynchracies
  when multiple arguments are passed on a bridge or
  transformer interface.  The order of arguments in the
  generated code is non-deterministic.  Bridge and transformer
  interface frameworks provide a level of indirection between
  the code generator and the server code.</p><p>Bridge and transformer skeletons are best used as hooks, call
  outs, to the realized domain.  Thus providing the indirection
  between generated code and hand written or purchased code.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2805275"></a>Can MC-3020 translate action language in bridge
  and transformer descriptions?</h2></div></div><p>Yes.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761081"></a>I really want to model reusable transformation processes.
  How do I do it best?</h2></div></div><p>Synchronous Services are supported as of BridgePoint Model Builder version 5.0.
  MC-3020 supports these synchronous services and recommends that
  inter-domain bridging use this mechanism.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761100"></a>What are Model Builder audits?</h2></div></div><p>BridgePoint Model Builder provides a model auditor.  It is available
  from the file menu on the Subsystem Component Diagram.
  This audit function will parse the model identifying
  syntax errors, unparsed actions, relationships that have
  not been formalized and several other problems and dangerous
  modeling practices.  It is not capable of catching every
  minute anomaly, but it does provide a good check.
  Often, a problem manifested during translation could have
  been detected (more cheaply) by a model audit.</p><p>Be sure to run a model audit before submitting a
  problem report against the model compiler.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761111"></a>Can an initialization object be passive?</h2></div></div><p>No.  Initialization by definition is processing.
  Therefore, initialization objects need to be active (capable
  of processing).</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2805133"></a>How do I initialize multiple domains?</h2></div></div><p>MC-3020 generates initialization code for the target
  system from action language defined in each initialization
  object.  The system bring up code invokes these initialization
  state actions.  The sequencing of initialization objects is
  not predictable.  Ordering of state actions within each
  initialization object is also unpredictable.
  This unpredictability is rooted in the data base access
  methods of the BridgePoint tool.  No explicit ordering can be
  assumed in the general case of <b>select many ...</b>
  </p><p>We recommend an approach hereby dubbed ``Omnipotent
  Domain Initialization'' (ODInit).  ODInit crowns one domain
  as sovereign over the others in regard to initialization.
  The Omnipotent Domain is all powerful when sequencing 
  initialization activities.  In terms of initialization
  sequencing requirements among all domains, the Omnipotent
  Domain must be all knowing.  The (truly omniscient)
  system architect (not software architect) must make this
  so.</p><p>ODInit is accomplished with a single initialization
  object for the entire system.  The action in this object's
  state machine will initialize its own domain and make
  bridge invocations into the subordinate domains.  The
  subordinate domains will each provide one to many bridge
  interfaces (synchronous services) to serve the Omnipotent Domain.</p><p>The ODInit approach
  keeps the specification of initialization sequencing and
  processing in the OOA where it belongs.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761402"></a>Can we talk philosophically about initialization?</h2></div></div><p>Sequencing of initialization of the domains is an analysis
  issue.  Since it falls outside of any single domain, it transcends
  the jurisdiction of the domain analysts.  The architecture can
  distinguish only ``system'' (architecture) from ``application'' and
  therefore sees very little if any boundary between domains.  The
  system will initialize itself before the application.  The
  application needs to sequence itself.  All sequencing info should
  be captured (and modeled) by the system architect(s) (not the
  software architects).</p><p>Consider that much of the sequencing of initialization can
  occur after ``initialization''.  Get the domains up and breathing
  with pre-existing instances, then start launching events and
  bridging with your buddies to get everybody coherent.  Perhaps the
  amount of ``populating and relating instances'' is small compared
  to the ``coordinating and sync'ing with other domains''.  We
  recommend going thin in your initialization object and fat on
  application models for as much as you can.</p><p>The developer might try to imagine initialization using a
  pre-populated data base of the OOA or by flash memory
  instantiation.  Our init object approach should not greatly deviate
  from this concept.  Avoid the trap of performing application
  processing in init objects.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761449"></a>How do I make the autosampler more interesting?</h2></div></div><p>The autosampler example model is intentionally
  small and simple.  (Even so, it nicely models a real
  world device.)  Generating code for the autosampler is
  an ideal first step in exploring MC-3020.  The Quick Start
  given in the users guide holds the hand of the novice
  during an initial drive of the model compiler.</p><p>The autosampler model is set up to get just a bit
  farther.  With a little bridge wiring, the generated code
  can perform more functions.</p><p>See example model with two OOA domains plus two realized
  domains on the download page on the ROX web site.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2805164"></a>What code goes into <tt>system/user/source</tt>?</h2></div></div><p>Actually, nothing goes into
  <tt>system/user/source</tt> unless placed there by the
  user.  MC-3020 will generate a makefile for this code and link
  everything it finds there.  Beyond that, it is off limits to the
  model compiler.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2805194"></a>How do I modify the build environment?</h2></div></div><p>The build environment is designed to be easily modified.  The
  design approach exhibits an intention to avoid anticipating and
  mandating any rigid strategy in compilation/link/locate land.
  MC-3020 opted for flexible and modifiable.  Makefiles are
  generated from archetypes.  A link script is generated.  Both can
  be tailored.  The link script is very easy to augment.  It already
  supports various linking/locating tool environments.</p><p>Consider establishing a strategy of building realized domains
  somewhat independently.  You could use other languages and tools if
  you desired.  You could even go so far as to build a library module
  of your realized code.  Use the bridge skeletons as indirection
  hooks as described above.  Change the <b>link_sys</b>
  script generator to link in realized ``libraries''.</p><p>To go further, modify the makefile generation to suit
  requirements.  A modification to support subdirectories under
  <tt>system/user/source</tt> would be minor.  However,
  it would be better to go get the user code from a directory outside
  the system node.  Again, this would require only a change to the
  <b>link_sys</b> generator.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761259"></a>R207?  Unformalized relationships?</h2></div></div><p>If an error message refers to R207 (relationship 207
  in the MC-3020 meta model), it means that the model being
  translated has an unformalized relationship.  This sort of
  error can be captured with an OOA audit in BridgePoint Model Builder.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761277"></a>How do I return a value from a bridge object (FBO)?</h2></div></div><p>Note that use of bridge objects is discouraged as of
  version 5.0 of BridgePoint Model Builder.  Synchronous services are available
  to provide cleaner bridging.</p><p>Provide an attribute of the bridge object with the
  same name as the state name representing the synchronously
  callable routine.  This attribute is the return value for
  this bridge service.  In your action language, set this
  attribute; it will be returned to the invoking domain (realized
  or OOA).</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761303"></a>How is an event marked as high priority?</h2></div></div><p>Color each event to be given more than default (0)
  priority by editing the <tt>event.clr</tt> coloring
  file for the domain receiving the event.  Provide:
  <pre class="programlisting">
  TagPriorityEvent( &quot;label&quot;, value )
  </pre>
  where ``label'' is the event name.  Value is between 0 and
  255 inclusive and represents the priority of the event.
  Higher values are higher priority.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761336"></a><b>ACTION_SPECIFICATION: TRUE</b> in transformer/bridge
  descriptions?</h2></div></div><p>MC-3020 version 1.3 and after translates action
  language in bridge and transformer descriptions.  Putting
  <b>ACTION_SPECIFICATION: TRUE</b> in a comment at the
  beginning of the bridge or transformer description will enable this
  code generation.</p><p>Bridges and transformers are treated alike in much of of
  MC-3020.  For example, skeleton implementation files are generated
  for each.  (See Bridge/Transform Skeleton Generation in the Users Guide.)
  Both serve as hooks into the the outside world from within the
  OOA domain.  However, description translation has some differences.</p><p>When translating the description of a transformer (tagged
  with ACTION_SPECIFICATION: TRUE), MC-3020 will generate a file
  into the appropriate <tt>gen/source</tt> directory
  (instead of the <tt>skeleton</tt> directory).
  When translating the description of a bridge (tagged appropriately),
  MC-3020 generates translated action language into the same skeleton
  files (source code frameworks) that are generated when not tagged.</p><p>The reason these are treated differently is because of a
  perceived difference in usefulness.  To ROX, translated transformers
  seem to carry natural value in the production environment.  However,
  translated bridges seem to have value only during ``simulation'' 
  style testing (stubbing out domains).</p><p>Note that if <b>ACTION_SPECIFICATION: FALSE</b>
  is encountered in a bridge or transformer description that the
  action language will not be translated.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2760959"></a>MC-3020 Extent Prediction and Coloring</h2></div></div><p>First pass translation collects statistics used to
    conservatively estimate the number of container nodes (containoids)
    required by the system.</p><p>There are three different uses for instance containoids:
    class extents, association extents and selection extents.
    Selection extents govern the total size of transient instance
    reference set variables in the actions.  This represents values
    in the variable type inst_ref_set.
    The required number of containoids for each flavor is summed
    to provide the upper limit to total containers.
    <pre class="programlisting">#define SYS_MAX_CONTAINERS \
    ( SYS_MAX_OBJECT_EXTENT + SYS_MAX_RELATIONSHIP_EXTENT + SYS_MAX_TRANSIENT_EXTENT )</pre></p><p>SYS_MAX_OBJECT_EXTENT is a sum of all of the extent counts across
    all the domains of the system, which are sums of the class extents
    in each domain.  Each class extent is allocated to be the system
    default for class extents, a colored value of the system default
    or the colored value for the specific class.</p><p>Selection extents are calculated by multiplying the largest
    number of selects that can occur in any action by the largest extent
    of any class.  Thus allowing for the worst case action to select
    the largest class extent each time.  This value is set in
    SYS_MAX_TRANSIENT_EXTENT.
    <pre class="programlisting">transient containers = ( max selects ) * ( largest class extent )</pre></p><p>Relationship extents are allowed to be as big as they would
    need to be if all instances on the MANY side were always
    participating.  This value is set in SYS_MAX_RELATIONSHIP_EXTENT.
    <pre class="programlisting">association containoids = ( number of MANYs ) * ( largest class extent )</pre></p><p>The following colors govern these extent sizes:

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><pre class="programlisting">TagObjectExtentSize( &quot;key_letters&quot;, value )</pre></li><li><pre class="programlisting">TagSystemObjectDefaultExtentSize( value )</pre></li><li><pre class="programlisting">TagMaximumRelationshipExtentSize( value )</pre></li><li><pre class="programlisting">TagMaximumSelectionExtentSize( value )</pre></li></ul></div><p>
    
    See the proper sections in the MC-3020 Users Guide for details
    on these coloring parameters.</p><p>Relationship extents refer to the sets of instances
    participating
    in a relationship with multiplicity MANY.  Sets built from
    linked lists are used to optimize traversal of relationships with
    multiplicity MANY.  For example, in the following model,
    A 1---R1---* B,
    object B does not need an extent set; it simply needs a single
    pointer reference to the A instance.  The A instance however does
    need a set of instance references.  Such a set uses &quot;containoids&quot;
    to collect the B instances related to the A instance.
    MC-3020 calculates the worst case (biggest possible) relationship
    extent.</p><p>The extent can be colored to be smaller than the worst case
    maximum using TagMaximumRelationshipExtentSize.
    <b>TagObjectExtentSize</b> will also have an effect on
    the calculated total.</p><p>If no extent size coloring is supplied, MC-3020 will
    calculate a worst case for a model of a higher number of
    containers.  MC-3020 will see R1 and allow for all possible
    instances of B to participate with instances of A.  (This is the
    most important point!)</p><p>Another way to understand how MC-3020 calculates this maximum
    is as follows:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Count the number of MANYs (---*) on a class
      diagram.</p></li><li><p> For each MANY (---*), add the maximum object
      extent on the MANY side (B above).</p></li><li><p>There are adjustments to be considered in the
      case of associative objects.</p></li></ol></div><p>
    This sum across all domains in the system will be the
    SYS_MAX_RELATIONSHIP_EXTENT.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2762081"></a>Does MC-3020 optimize instance selection?</h2></div></div><p>ROX has researched the selection process and provided substantial
  optimization in MC-3020.  During the first pass of translation,
  selection statements are identified of the form 'select any [inst_ref]
  from instances of [key_letters] where [where clause]' when the where
  clause is checking for equality of the identifier.  Such selection
  statements represent a common pattern seen in many applications.
  (You may see reference in the archetypes to &quot;special where&quot; clauses.)</p><p>MC-3020 optimizes these selections for code space by consolidating
  the searching into subroutines.  This consolidation eliminates
  redundancy in the generated code.  In addition, these selection
  functions allow some embedded processors to use internal registers
  more efficiently, thus improving speed.  (Such speed-ups have been
  experienced with 8051 and 80C167 family processors using Tasking
  brand C compilers.)</p><p>For future feature enhancement and for flexibility of customization,
  hooks into these scanning routines are provided at the archetype
  and generated code level.  These hooks ease the task of providing
  application specific collection search code.  Binary searching and
  hashing have been considered for certain applications.  However,
  off-the-shelf MC-3020 does not supply this application specific
  search support.</p><p>Research performed on MC-3020 shows that collections need to be
  substantial (hundreds or thousands) before customizations to the
  selection algorithms provide real application reward.  The simple
  algorithms provided are tight and fast even though very simple.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2762116"></a>How does MC-3020 manufacture unique IDs?</h2></div></div><p>When an object is synchronously created (with a
  <b>create object instance</b> command, any identifying
  attribute of type unique_ID will simply get the address of the
  instance.  This certainly relies on the single data address space
  nature of this architecture.</p><p>The algorithm for determining the form of a unique_ID
  is internal to the model compiler.  Any analysis assumptions
  made about such are made at analyst peril!</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2761490"></a>When compiling with LegOS, <b>strncat</b>
  and <b>strncpy</b> cause the link to fail.  Why?</h2></div></div><p>LegOS (necessarily) provides a stripped down version
  of the C string libraries.  <b>strncat</b> and
  <b>strncpy</b> are not defined by LegOS.  However,
  <b>strcat</b> and <b>strcpy</b> are.
  Change the archetype <tt>sys_mechs.arc</tt> to
  use these simpler (although more dangerous) versions of string
  functions.</p><p>Note that in version 3.0 of MC-3020, the string library
  function calls have been eliminated.  Native C is used
  throughout.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
