MC-3020 Modeling Parameters

A model of a realized domain will be supplied with the following
bridge operations (domain functions):

ubyte_t light_sensor( sensor:s );
/* sensor is of type sensor_selector_t which is an enumerated type
   with values light_sensor_1, light_sensor_2, light_sensor_3.    */

void motor_direction( motor:m, direction:d );
void motor_speed( motor:m, speed:s );
/* motor is of type motor_selector_t which is an enumerated type
   with values motor_brake, motor_coast, motor_forward, motor_reverse.
   direction is of type motor_direction_t which is an enumerated type
   with values motor_brake, motor_coast, motor_forward, motor_reverse.
   speed is of type ubyte_t (unsigned char) with values ranging
   from 0 to 255.  0 is the least power; 255 is the most power.   */
