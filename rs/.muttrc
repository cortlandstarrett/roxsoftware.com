set hostname=roxsoftware.com
# Specifies the hostname to use after the ``@'' in local e-mail
# addresses. This overrides the compile time definition obtained from
# /etc/resolv.conf.


set use_domain=yes
# When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
# @host portion) with the value of ````$hostname''''. If unset, no
# addresses will be qualified.


set beep=no
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.


set duplicate_threads=yes
# This variable controls whether mutt, when sorting by threads, threads
# messages with the same message-id together. If it is set, it will
# indicate that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an
# equals sign in the thread diagram.


set abort_unmodified=no
# If set to yes, composition will automatically abort after editing the
# message body if no changes are made to the file (this check only happens
# after the first edit of the file). When set to no, composition will never be aborted.


set abort_nosubject=ask-yes
# If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is given at the subject prompt,
# composition will be aborted. If set to no, composing messages with no subject given at
# the subject prompt will never be aborted.


set attribution='On %{%a, %d %b %Y}, %n wrote:\n'


set auto_tag=yes
# When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message will be applied
# to all tagged messages (if there are any). When unset, you must first use the 
# tag-prefix function (default: ";") to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.


set collapse_unread=yes


set uncollapse_jump=yes
# When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
# when the current thread is uncollapsed.


set copy=yes
# This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages will be
# saved for later references. Also see `` $record'', `` $save_name'', `` $force_name'' and `` fcc-hook'


set followup_to=yes
# Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To header field is generated when sending mail. 
# When set, Mutt will generate this field when you are replying to a known mailing list,
# specified with the ``subscribe'' or `` lists'' commands


set history=30
# This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of the string history buffer.
# The buffer is cleared each time the variable is set.


set realname="Cortland Starrett"
# This variable specifies what "real" or "personal" name should be used
# when sending messages.
# By default, this is the GCOS field from /etc/passwd. Note that this
# variable will not be used when the user has set a real name in the
# ``$from'' variable.


set from=cort@roxsoftware.com
# When set, this variable contains a default from address. It can be
# overridden using my_hdr (including from send-hooks) and
# ````$reverse_name''''.
# Defaults to the EMAIL environment variable's content.


# set envelope_from
# When set, mutt will try to derive the message's envelope sender from
# the "From:" header. Note that this information is passed to sendmail
# command using the "-f" command line switch, so don't set this option
# if you are using that switch in ``$sendmail'' yourself, or if the
# sendmail on your machine doesn't support that command line switch.


set include=ask-yes
# Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to is included in your reply.


set move=no
# Controls whether you will be asked to confirm moving read messages from your spool mailbox
# to your `` $mbox'' mailbox, or as a result of a `` mbox-hook'' command.


set pager_context=1
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given when displaying
# the next or previous page in the internal pager. By default, Mutt will display the
# line after the last one on the screen at the top of the next page (0 lines of context)


set pager_index_lines=3
# Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
# the pager. The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
# folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
# giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
# message. This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
# remain to be read in the current thread. One of the lines is reserved
# for the status bar from the index, so a pager_index_lines of 6 will
# only show 5 lines of the actual index. A value of 0 results in no
# index being shown. If the number of messages in the current folder is
# less than pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as many
# lines as it needs.


set pager_stop=yes
# When set, the internal-pager will not move to the next message when
# you are at the end of a message and invoke the next-page function.


set postpone=ask-yes
# Controls whether or not messages are saved in the
# '$postponed' mailbox when you elect not to send immediately


set postponed=~/mail/postponed
# folder for postponed messages


#set signature=~/mail/signature
# Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all outgoing messages.
# If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is assumed that filename is a shell
# command and input should be read from its stdout.


set record=~/mail/mailsent
# This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be appended.
# (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of your messages, but
# another way to do this is using the `` my_hdr'' command to create a Bcc: field
# with your email address in it.)The value of $record is overridden by the
# `` $force_name'' and `` $save_name'' variables, and the `` fcc-hook'' command. 


set copy=yes
# This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages will be saved for later references.
# Also see `` $record'', `` $save_name'', `` $force_name'' and `` fcc-hook''. 


set mark_old=no
# Controls whether or not Mutt makes the distinction between new messages and old unread messages.
# By default, Mutt will mark new messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
# The next time you start Mutt, the messages will show up with an "O" next to them in the index menu,
# indicating that they are old.
# In order to make Mutt treat all unread messages as new only, you can unset this variable.


set reply_to=ask-yes
# If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the address listed in the
# Reply-To: header field when replying to a message. If you answer no,
# it will use the address in the From: header field instead. This
# option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
# header field to the list address and you want to send a private
# message to the author of a message.


set send_charset=us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8
# A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
# first character set into which the text can be converted exactly. If
# your ````$charset'''' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not
# understand UTF-8, it is advisable to include in the list an
# appropriate widely used standard character set (such as iso-8859-2,
# koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either instead of or after "iso-8859-1".


#set sendmail="/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi -f oliverfuchs@oliverfuchs.de"

# Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
# Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
# arguments as recipient addresses.
# The same function can be found in:
# 6.3.43. envelope_from
#
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
# When set, mutt will try to derive the message's envelope sender from
# the "From:" header. Note that this information is passed to sendmail
# command using the "-f" command line switch, so don't set this option
# if you are using that switch in ``$sendmail'' yourself, or if the
# sendmail on your machine doesn't support that command line switch.


# Ignoring (weeding) unwanted message headers
# Usage: [un]ignore pattern [ pattern ... ]
# Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing
# systems, or which may not seem useful to display on the screen. This
# command allows you to specify header fields which you don't normally
# want to see.
# You do not need to specify the full header field name. For example,
# ``ignore content-'' will ignore all header fields that begin with the
# pattern ``content-''.
# To remove a previously added token from the list, use the ``unignore''
# command.  Note that if you do ``ignore x-'' it is not possible to
# ``unignore x-mailer,'' for example. The ``unignore'' command does not
# make Mutt display headers with the given pattern.
# ``unignore *'' will remove all tokens from the ignore list.
# From Sven's draconian header weeding

# Searching by Date
# Mutt supports two types of dates, absolute and relative.
############ 
# Absolute #
############ 
# Dates must be in DD/MM/YY format (month and year are
# optional, defaulting to the current month and year). An example of a
# valid range of dates is: Limit to messages matching: ~d 20/1/95-31/10
# If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify ``-DD/MM/YY'',
# all messages before the given date will be selected. If you omit the
# maximum (second) date, and specify ``DD/MM/YY-'', all messages after
# the given date will be selected. If you specify a single date with no
# dash (``-''), only messages sent on the given date will be selected.
# Error Margins. You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error
# margin is a sign (+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by one of the
# following units:
# y years
# m months
# w weeks
# d days
# As a special case, you can replace the sign by a ``*'' character,
# which is equivalent to giving identical plus and minus error margins.
# Example: To select any messages two weeks around January 15, 2001,
# you'd use the following pattern: Limit to messages matching: ~d 15/1/2001*2w
###########
#Relative #
###########
# This type of date is relative to the current date, and may
# be specified as:
# >offset (messages older than offset units)
# # =offset (messages exactly offset units old)
# offset is specified as a positive number with one of the following
# units:
# y years
# m months
# w weeks
# d days
# Example: to select messages less than 1 month old, you would use
# Limit to messages matching: ~d <1m

source ~/mail/aliases
# Usage: source filename. This command allows the inclusion of initialization commands
