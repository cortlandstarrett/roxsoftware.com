Dear David,

Here is the body of an e-mail sent 12/9.  I will follow with more
on version 0.8 spec.

Let's put it away accurate and useful as a starting point for
future endeavors.  It was a worthwhile exercise.  If nothing else,
it captured our agreement as we went.

Dear David,

Sorry for dissing you this afternoon.  It was not intentional.  I had
someone on the other line when you called, and it took way more than the
five or minutes expected...

Here is more feedback to finalize the spec.

Feature Matrix:

1.2 -  The only issue here is that I've never read the UML Debugger
Project Specification.  I read an early "Blue" design note...

1.3  What exactly is a build specification?  Are these command line
options to make?  Do I need to automatically color debugging if 3020
sees this option?

1.4  Same as 1.3.

1.5  It will actually be ROX_TM_ENABLED for consistency with all
other similar compile options and flags.

2.2  Same as 1.2.

2.3  Same as 1.2.

4.3  MC-3020 does not use attribute accessors but writes directly.

5.7  Let's do as this says.  We will document the danger of creating
identical pre-existing instances.  (Note, however, that identical
instances not specifically an initialization issue.)  We will also
document the danger of "unique_id" type identifiers and PEIs
defined in data.  These unique_ids are pointer values dumped from
a previous build.  There is the possibility of clashing unique_ids
from PEIs in data with new instances!

6.2  Never did hear from Shaun.  My research indicates no problem.
There will be credit, disclosure of GPL and access to the web site, etc.
[This is a different 6.2 than in the 0.8 spec.]

At bottom is an update of the schedule.  The additions from the spec
(tagging functions for init, etc) have not so much affected the progress
as the Unicode support and Reflexives issues.  With your permission, I
would like to slip the schedule to Christmas and deliver before year
end.

Let me know.

For 5.7, MC-3020 will support generation of initial instances using
executable programming language statements for any classes regardless
of whether or not they have PEIs defined in data.  Data PEIs and
dynamic PEIs are completely independent.

For 6.1, we did go with TagInitializationFunction.

Everything else looks good.

Cort
