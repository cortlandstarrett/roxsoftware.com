[What is a pilot phase?]

[My answers are pretty positive here.  Tone them down if need be.]

[It sounds like phased delivery to a site or enterprise license
is in the works here.  Perhaps monies are collected over a one year
period of time as the project (pilot) progresses.  The total dollars
being large, the initial outlay reasonable.  A buy out option gets
them out from under some of the balloon at the end (in case of project
failure) but leaves PT/ROX compensated.]

This can be done.  It will take work.  It will not likely be available
before autumn (without a financial push).  This will be a feature of
the product.

Some code size shrinkage is planned for delivery in 1.3.  The June
delivery will provide code size reduction without sacrificing speed.
Further reduction in size may be available after this initial delivery.

ROX can provide advice (or actual archtype updates) on the necessary
changes fairly easily.

A specialized mechanism could accomplish this.  If StJ provides the
lowest level control of the hardware, an API could be formulated that
allocates timers from this pool and returns them to the pool.  At the
highest level (action language interface) the "bridges" look the same.

A couple of possibilities are available.  Some involve restrictions
on the analyst.

One solution would look like the following:
  1.  During first pass, identify state actions that do not
      send multiple events to self (from within the single state
      action).  [Hopefully, there are very few actions that 
      do such a thing!]
  2.  Tag events to self in these actions as using the instance
      queue.
  3.  Other self events would be posted normally to the self queue.
  4.  Post self events to the instance queue by starting at the
      front and moving backward until an event of equal or lower
      priority is reached OR an event destined to the same instance
      is reached.  Post in front of this event.
This is a reflection of the current prioritization from the back
of the instance queue.

An initial (simple) version of this capability is scheduled to ship
at the end June.

If there are customizations provided as part of the sale to be
delivered on or after the sale, a statement of work would be drafted.
This SOW would clearly outline the expectations of all parties.
It would be more engineering oriented than legal oriented.

An hourly (or project/feature oriented) consulting service could be
provided for enhancements above and beyond the SOW.  This would
cover StJ-specific/desired enhancements not covered by normal
maintenance.

[You can answer this.  I personally would be willing to visit their
site with specific design/training goals estabished ahead of time.
Most support will be basement design time through the night.]

Provided in printed form and only with a full license.
