Rationale - Why Lego Robots?

MC-3020 is a UML model translator ideal for small systems, especially
deeply embedded control systems.  Often these deeply embedded control
systems are running a small, 8-bit or 16-bit micros.  Can high-level
tools such as BridgePoint be used to model and efficiently generate
code for such small systems?  How better to demonstrate than to actually
do so onto a small system.

The Lego RCX programmable brick runs the Renesas (formerly Hitachi)
H8 microcontroller.

This microcontroller run 32 kbytes of RAM.  It has several peripherals
including analog inputs, pulse width modulators, LCD interface, serial
interface controller, timers and more.  This is a small processor but
is a workhorse.  It represents an excellent example of a typical,
deeply embeddable microcontroller.

Translating UML models to run on this platform can demonstrate that the
tools normally thought to be for the big system developers are available
for the small systems world.


General Instructions
