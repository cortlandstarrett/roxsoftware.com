Rugged Individualism?

Lately, I have been wrestling with a nagging thought.  I think I
think that rugged individualism can be a Bad Thing.

In the Midwest U.S. especially, this is borderline heresy.  It
also goes against what I learned in history of pioneers and our
forefathers.

Before disparaging my rugged individual friends, let me state my
alternative.  More than rugged individualism today we need
inspiring leadership, loyal followership and a recognition of
specialization.

The rugged individual says, "I can do it."... even when someone
else can do it better, faster, cheaper, funner and righter.

The rugged individual says, "I don't need help."  Perhaps recognizing
the difference between _need_ and prudence.  The rugged individual
certainly does not NEED help, but perhaps could wisely use help in
proper situations.  The cooperative specialist may not _need_ help
making light bulbs, but it sure makes sense to use help.

The rugged individual says, "You don't need help."  This is certainly
foisting a philosophy a bit.  Again, maybe need is too strong....

Most of the cool engineering projects to be done today require
input from multiple specialties.  It takes a wide and disparate
combination of skills to accomplish today's most interesting and
lucrative development tasks.  A loner is at a disadvantage.

An inspiring leader can rally cooperative specialists who themselves
have varying degrees of inspiring leadership and loyal followership
proclivities.  Among a group there will be present a greater
representation of specialization.  Each member of this new "body"
of development expertise will function in concert with the other
members.  The whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.
The body parts will optimize for their roles.

The rugged individual may be admired.  The lone pioneer spirit may
be necessary in many situations.  However, individualism to the 
exclusion of participation is non-optimal.
