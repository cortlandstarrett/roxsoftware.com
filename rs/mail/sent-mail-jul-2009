Dear HE,

I am a customer for 1 account (roxsoftware.com... 11 years! :) and the
technical contact for 2 others (bgbc.org and grandcaymanmotors.com).
The latter account, grandcaymanmotors.com, was recently closed (company
went out of business).

I down-graded the account to the cheaper version and took it over.
Can I get access to the HTML from the old site?

Thank you,
Cort
