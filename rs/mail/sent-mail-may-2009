Dear HE,

I am a customer for 1 account (roxsoftware.com... 11 years!) and the
technical contact for 2 others (bgbc.org and grandcaymanmotors.com).
The latter account, grandcaymanmotors.com, was recently closed (company
went out of business).

I would like to keep the domain name and have the e-mail received at
a Google Apps site.

How do I move or edit DNS for this domain, which I still own but is
on a cancelled HE account?

Thank you,
Cort

Do we have apache mod_rewrite support?
