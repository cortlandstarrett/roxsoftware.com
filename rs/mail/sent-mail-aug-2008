Dear Support,

I believe someone has installed some files in my site.  I was able
to rename the folders but cannot remove the foreign files.

I had some write permissions wrong, and I believe I have corrected it.

Find under my public_html/robots/sumo/t1 and public_html/robots/spinsteer/t1.

Thank you,
Cort
