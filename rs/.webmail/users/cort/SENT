Dear Pastor Leffew,

Would you provide to me a date for a decision on the computer class?  I
would like to bound this issue.  :)

Serving you Serving Him,
Cort

Dear HE,

I am interested in using Gmail and Google Apps with my roxsoftware.com
and bgbc.org domains.  Is this possible?  Google Apps states that I must
have access to my MX and CNAME records of DNS.

Please advise.

Thank you,
Cortland Starrett
